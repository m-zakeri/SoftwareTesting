@article{DeMott2007,
	abstract = {Runtime code coverage analysis is feasible and useful when application source code is not available. An evolutionary test tool receiving such statistics can use that information as fitness for pools of sessions to actively learn the interface protocol. We call this activity grey-box fuzzing. We intend to show that, when applicable, grey-box fuzzing is more effective at finding bugs than RFC compliant or capture-replay mutation black-box tools. This research is focused on building a better/new breed of fuzzer. The impact of which is the discovery of difficult to find bugs in real world applications which are accessible (not theoretical). We have successfully combined an evolutionary approach with a debugged target to get real-time grey-box code coverage (CC) fitness data. We build upon existing test tool General Purpose Fuzzer (GPF) [8], and existing reverse engineering and debugging framework PaiMei [10] to accomplish this. We call our new tool the Evolutionary Fuzzing System (EFS), which is the initial realization of my PhD thesis. We have shown that it is possible for our system to learn the targets language (protocol) as target communication sessions become more fit over time. We have also shown that this technique works to find bugs in a real world application. Initial results are promising though further testing is still underway. This paper will explain EFS, describing its unique features, and present preliminary results for one test case. We will also discuss ongoing research efforts. First we begin with some background and related works. Previous},

@article{Holler2012,
	abstract = {Fuzz testing is an automated technique providing random data as input to a software system in the hope to expose a vulnerability. In order to be effective, the fuzzed input must be common enough to pass elementary consistency checks; a JavaScript interpreter, for instance, would only accept a semantically valid program. On the other hand, the fuzzed input must be uncommon enough to trigger exceptional behavior, such as a crash of the interpreter. The LangFuzz approach resolves this conflict by using a grammar to randomly generate valid programs; the code fragments, however, partially stem from programs known to have caused invalid behavior before. LangFuzz is an effective tool for security testing: Applied on the Mozilla JavaScript interpreter, it discovered a total of 105 new severe vulnerabilities within three months of operation (and thus became one of the top security bug bounty collectors within this period); applied on the PHP interpreter, it discovered 18 new defects causing crashes.},

In this paper, we will systematically review these techniques and their corresponding representative fuzzing systems. By introducing the principles, advantages and disadvantages of these techniques, we hope to provide researchers with a systematic and deeper understanding of fuzzing techniques and provide some references for this field.},

It is used to identify the correctness, completeness, security and quality of software products against a specification. Software testing is the process used to measure the quality of developed computer software. It exhibits all mistakes, errors and flaws in the developed software. There are many approaches to software testing, but effective testing of complex product is essentially a process of investigation, not merely a matter of creating and following route procedure. It is not possible to find out all the errors in the program. This fundamental problem in testing thus throws an open question, as to what would be the strategy we should adopt for testing. In our paper, we have described and compared the three most prevalent and commonly used software testing techniques for detecting errors, they are: white box testing, black box testing and grey box testing.},

	abstract = {This updated and reorganized fourth edition of Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approachapplies the strong mathematics content of previous editions to a coherent treatment of Model-Based Testing for both code-based (structural) and specification-based (functional) testing. These techniques are extended from the usual unit testing discussions to full coverage of less understood levels integration and system testing. The Fourth Edition: * Emphasizes technical inspections and is supplemented by an appendix with a full package of documents required for a sample Use Case technical inspection * Introduces an innovative approach that merges the Event-Driven Petri Nets from the earlier editions with the "Swim Lane" concept from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that permits model-based testing for four levels of interaction among constituents in a System of Systems * Introduces model-based development and provides an explanation of how to conduct testing within model-based development environments * Presents a new section on methods for testing software in an Agile programming environment * Explores test-driven development, reexamines all-pairs testing, and explains the four contexts of software testing Thoroughly revised and updated, Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach, Fourth Edition is sure to become a standard reference for those who need to stay up to date with evolving technologies in software testing. Carrying on the tradition of previous editions, it will continue to serve as a valuable reference for software testers, developers, and engineers.},

	abstract="We present an automated evolutionary fuzzing technique to find bugs in JavaScript interpreters. Fuzzing is an automated black box testing technique used for finding security vulnerabilities in the software by providing random data as input. However, in the case of an interpreter, fuzzing is challenging because the inputs are piece of codes that should be syntactically/semantically valid to pass the interpreter's elementary checks. On the other hand, the fuzzed input should also be uncommon enough to trigger exceptional behavior in the interpreter, such as crashes, memory leaks and failing assertions. In our approach, we use evolutionary computing techniques, specifically genetic programming, to guide the fuzzer in generating uncommon input code fragments that may trigger exceptional behavior in the interpreter. We implement a prototype named IFuzzer to evaluate our technique on real-world examples. IFuzzer uses the language grammar to generate valid inputs. We applied IFuzzer first on an older version of the JavaScript interpreter of Mozilla (to allow for a fair comparison to existing work) and found 40 bugs, of which 12 were exploitable. On subsequently targeting the latest builds of the interpreter, IFuzzer found 17 bugs, of which four were security bugs.",

Because of this variety, the security testing of web browsers is a diverse field of research. Typical publicly available tools for browser security testing are fuzz test case generators designed to target a single feature of a browser on a single platform. This work introduces a cross-platform testing harness for browser fuzz testing, called NodeFuzz. In the design of NodeFuzz, test case generators and instrumentation are separated from the core into separate modules. This allows the user to implement feature specific test case generators and platform specific instrumentations, and to execute those in different combinations. During development, NodeFuzz was tested with ten different test case generators and six different instrumentation modules. Over 50 vulnerabilities were uncovered from the tested web browsers during the development and testing of NodeFuzz.},

    abstract = {Appropriate test data are a crucial factor to succeed in fuzz testing. Most of the real-world applications, however, accept complex structure inputs containing data surrounded by meta-data which is processed in several stages comprising of the parsing and rendering (execution). The complex structure of some input files makes it difficult to generate efficient test data automatically. The success of deep learning to cope with complex tasks, specifically generative tasks, has motivated us to exploit it in the context of test data generation for complicated structures such as PDF files. In this respect, a neural language model (NLM) based on deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is used to learn the structure of complex inputs. To target both the parsing and rendering steps of the software under test (SUT), our approach generates new test data while distinguishing between data and meta-data that significantly improve the input fuzzing. To assess the proposed approach, we have developed a modular file format fuzzer, IUST-DeepFuzz. Our experimental results demonstrate the relatively high coverage of MuPDF code by our proposed fuzzer, IUST-DeepFuzz, in comparison with the state-of-the-art tools such as learn{\&}fuzz, AFL, Augmented-AFL, and random fuzzing. In summary, our experiments with many deep learning models revealed the fact that the simpler the deep learning models applied to generate test data, the higher the code coverage of the software under test will be.},

    abstract = {Fuzzing is a dynamic software testing technique. In this technique with repeated generation and injection of malformed test data to the software under test (SUT), we are looking for the possible errors and vulnerabilities. Files are significant inputs to most real-world applications. Many of test data which are generated for fuzzing such programs are rejected by the parser because they are not in the acceptable format and this results in a low code coverage in the process of fuzz testing. Using the grammatical structure of input files to generate test data leads to increase code coverage. However, often, the grammar extraction is performed manually, which is a time consuming, costly and error-prone task. In this paper, a new method, based on deep neural language models (NLMs), is proposed for automatically learning the file structure and then generating and fuzzing test data. Our experiments demonstrate that the data produced by this method leads to an increase in the code coverage compared to previous test data generation methods. For MuPDF software, which accepts the PDF complex file format as an input, we have more than 1.30 to 12 percent improvement in code coverage than both the intelligence and random methods.},
